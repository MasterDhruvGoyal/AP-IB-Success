      "prompt": "A customer at a gas station is pumping gasoline into a gas tank. The rate of flow of gasoline is modeled by a differentiable function f, where f(t) is measured in gallons per second and t is measured in seconds since pumping began. Selected values of f(t) are given in the table.",

          "answer": "Yes. \\( f \\) is differentiable, so \\( f \\) is continuous on \\[ 60, 120 \\]. \\( f(120) - f(60) = 0.1 - 0.1 = 0 \\). By the Mean Value Theorem, there must exist a \\( c \\), for \\( 60 < c < 120 \\), such that \\( f'(c) = 0 \\).",

Using this model, find the average rate of flow of gasoline over the time interval \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq 150 \\). Show the setup for your calculations.",
          "answer": "The average rate is \\( \\frac{1}{150} \\int_0^{150} g(t) \\, dt \\approx 0.096 \\) gallons per second.",
